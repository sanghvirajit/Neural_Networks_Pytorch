In this, feedforward and the convolution neural network (CNN) were build using Pytorch deep learning framework for the handwritten digit classification (MNIST Dataset).

1. Feedforward neural network

In this example, a very simple neural network with 3 layers was build. 

Training accuray: 94.155 %

Testing accuracy: 93.640 % 

2. Convolution neural network (CNN)

In this example, a very simple CNN with 3 convolution layers, 2 maxpool layers and 2 fully connected layers were used. 

Training accuray: 98.347 %

Testing accuracy: 98.550 %
